# PySynth: Dataset Synthesis for Python

PySynth is a package to create synthetic datasets - that is, datasets that look
just like the original in terms of statistical properties, variable values,
distributions and correlations, but do not have exactly the same contents
so are safe against data disclosure.

## Installation
